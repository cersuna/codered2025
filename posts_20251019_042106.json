    "text": "Late night thoughts on $HIMS. Up to 3,800 shares Good night. Morning to some, night to myself.\n\nI haven't shared much recently, but I thought I'd start sharing a bit more, who knows maybe get some good feedback or told to go back into my hiding hole.\n\nSo I'll share some of the latest on what I've been up to‚Äîthough some of you might not care‚Äîlike the fact that we reloaded on HIMS this week. My total share count is now 3,800 shares, worth a bit under 200 grand. Right now, I'm only doing share purchases because of how wildly this thing moves. Overall, I‚Äôll keep my thoughts ‚Äúdue diligence‚Äù short, not diving into too many numbers, but it's clear this is a company that will continue to grow. For those between 18 and 30, we tend not to be very old school. We don't go to doctors or get our prescriptions ourselves, let alone pick them up. It's mostly just easy to do online. ‚ÄúNot my situation‚Äù but if someones piecer down there isn‚Äôt working properly, they don't want to see a doctor‚Äîjust order some pills online. If I'm a little chubby, I can order a medication. If I'm losing hair, I can buy shampoo or hair growth tools online. That's the main story here.\n\nI don‚Äôt want to compare it too much to other stocks, but similar to Robinhood, as companies grow and appeal to this demographic, they add new features in a relatively short period of time. Robinhood, for example, recently introduced integrated sports betting or event contract trading, as they call it to sound a bit less degenarte, and similar things happen on HIMS. We don‚Äôt go more than a month without getting news about new treatments‚Äîeither on the HERS side or the HIMS side. I believe this trend will continue, with the company gaining market share and expanding.\n\nFor people familiar with HIMS, I think they're the leader in this space. Looking at my close friends, I'd say seven out of ten use a HIMS product. Maybe we're all just balding, or maybe they just have a great product or service. Overall, I see this as a growth story. It‚Äôll continue expanding and getting bigger. The branding looks good, the interface is nice and user-friendly, and the overall outlook is positive. I currently have $200,000 invested, and I want to grow that to over half a million to start playing some options. If the price dips to around $40, I'll buy some call options, either six months or a year out.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y2x5dolcuzvf1.png?width=2130&format=png&auto=webp&s=a41f4de5b13e8e5cfa4e03cea78db9b33d14da37",

The price then dropped and I did something even more retarded, I doubled and tripled down on the position throughout the day Thursday.

I always knew betting on a piece of crap like the 2X Inverse was foolish. However, after seeing Rigetti's absurd P/S and option ratios, I sold my Google stock, which had been generating steady profits for months, and combined the money I had with my cash to bet on the Rigetti Inverse for the first time in my life, with 2X leverage. Beginner's luck wasn't on my side. The result was -15%.\n\nOf course, from an accounting standpoint, today's trade was a $3,000 profit, but for me, it was a painful loss exceeding -$4,600. I broke my principles and did something foolish. I lost the expected return on the Google stock I bought at a good price, and I destroyed all the small savings I'd always saved.\n\nThe trading experience was horrific. I truly experienced firsthand what Warren Buffett meant when he said, \"Risk is pain.\" When I sold off my Google stock, which had been generating steady profits, and placed a buy order on the 2X inverse, as if I were betting on a hand of cards at a casino, I was already shaking and my heart rate was soaring. I bought right in the early premarket, which was essentially a buy at the peak, and it was a huge burden and pain for me.\n\nBecause the US stock market is like dawn in Korea, I couldn't sleep a wink all night and suffered from tremendous mental and 'physical pain' all night. It was truly astonishing how stress can have such a profound effect on the human body.\n\nI know there are many people here who have lost far, far more than I have.\n\nBut I'm writing this to share with you the lessons I learned from this agonizing night.\n\n\n\nDon't gamble, invest.\n\n  \nSincerely, Lee.",

The 500m note move seems short term enough, they have their earnings on the 12th, and perhaps the sector can have a comeback. Though the current state of things, or more specifically where things might go next, time decay, and holy shit IV is making this hard. \n\nIf I do loose 30k, or maybe a little more I think it‚Äôs just a very expensive lesson and I would only be loosing money that I made on the stock market. I hope maybe my losses can make some of you feel better by looking at your own portfolio.",

    "text": "Why BTQ can be the best of the other quantum stocks and 10x. \nOn Thursday 16, BTQ demonstrated quantum-resistant bitcoin using NIST technology. News link below.\n\nhttps://stocktwits.com/news-articles/markets/equity/btq-technologies-stock-jumps-after-quantum-safe-bitcoin-demonstration/ch6pIqXR3nU\n\nOverall the company focuses in the below immediate industry needs:\n\n1) Addressing an Immediate Need \n\nThe threat of quantum computers breaking current cryptographic systems is more foreseeable than the timeline for full-scale quantum machines. BTQ‚Äôs focus on post-quantum cryptography is tackling a pressing demand that organizations (governments, financial institutions, infrastructure) will need before large quantum computers are widely usable. Just imagine if Bitcoin would be encrypted and all crypto market fail this create negative systematic repercussions on the financial system. From a regulatory standpoint this is a priority.\n\n2) Vertical Stack & Differentiation\n\nUnlike many peers that focus purely on hardware or component-level bets, BTQ is building a vertically integrated stack: algorithms, software, hardware-accelerators, toolkits. This gives it the potential to capture value across multiple layers rather than competing on narrow hardware alone.\n\n3) Lower Execution Risk (Relative to Pure Hardware Plays)\n\nHardware quantum machines face immense engineering and scalability challenges. By contrast, cryptographic and algorithmic resilience work is more incremental and aligns more closely with existing compute / security markets. While not zero risk, it‚Äôs less of a moonshot compared to some hardware-only plays.\n\nOf course, these upside arguments depend heavily on BTQ executing well, gaining adoption, and navigating dilution; and also on the timeline and competitive dynamics of quantum and cryptographic markets. \n\nBut from a speculative investor‚Äôs viewpoint, BTQ offers a differentiated risk/reward profile compared to more conventional pure-quantum-hardware bets.\n\nBTQ has circa $ 1.6bn market cap. The rest of the quantum stocks are valued between $4.8-$27.2B. At par, that‚Äôs a 2.5-14x from today‚Äôs closing share price - so circa $30-$170USD.\n\nI hold 16792 shares and not selling until $100.",

    "text": "ABAT is gonna drop tomorrow at open 10/17 - in for 68k - DD included Called this one out on premarket chat but - it's gonna rip on open. It's not just a trend trade, there's more to this last few days.\n\nSo - I got the idea for this stock from you guys, someone dropped the SEC 8k filing here.\n\nThat got me looking at it in detail - and the timeline don't make much sense:\n\n* **Sept 1, 2023:** Gets $57.7M DOE grant for lithium project. Stock pumps.\n* **May 15, 2025:** DOE issues memo - all MESC grants getting audited for \"federal stewardship and substantial involvement.\" Translation: where'd you put our fucking money?\n* **Oct 9, 2025:** DOE terminates their grant. Company knows internally.\n* **Oct 13, 2025:** Company releases fluff PR about \"submitting baseline studies\" for regulatory approval. Retail buys the \"good news.\"\n* **Oct 14, 2025:** Board of Directors amends bylaws to make it harder to fire themselves (more on this in a sec)\n* **Oct 15, 2025 @ 5:15 PM:** Finally disclose the grant termination. After hours, stock craters from $8.95 to $5.32 in minutes.\n\nThey sat on material negative news for six days while pumping positive PR.\n\nHere's where it gets spicy. The 8-K says \"as of October 9, 2025 there were approximately $52 million of reimbursable DOE funds remaining.\"\n\nCool cool cool. So where is it?\n\n**June 30, 2025 Balance Sheet:**\n\n* Cash: $7.47M\n* Grants receivable: $244K\n\nThey claim they \"already raised over $52 million of funds from the public markets\" to replace it. But their balance sheet doesn't show it - at least as of last June.\n\n**What they DID spend money on (FY2025):**\n\n* General & Administrative: $21.2M (up 31% YoY)\n* Research & Development: $8.5M (down 41% YoY)\n* Stock-based compensation: $13.9M\n\nThey spent MORE on admin costs and LESS on actual R&D. Revenue? Basically zero. They made $4.3M but had $14.9M cost of goods sold. Negative gross margin of $10.5M.\n\n# The Bylaw Coup\n\nNow here's the really fun part. That Oct 14th bylaw amendment - buried in the same 8-K as the grant loss - isn't just \"clarifications.\" It's a power grab:\n\n**Key changes:**\n\n1. **Director removal threshold:** Increased to TWO-THIRDS of outstanding shares (up from simple majority). They chose the hardest option right before bad news.\n2. **Quorum requirements:** Only need 33.3% present for meetings, but 67% to remove directors. Math doesn't math unless you're trying to make shareholder action impossible.\n3. **Board compensation:** \"Directors shall be entitled to such compensation for their services as may be approved by vote of the Board of Directors.\" They set their own pay.\n4. **Meeting calls:** Board can call meetings by email. Stockholders need 25% of shares AND must deliver written notice.\n\nTranslation: \"We just lost $52M of taxpayer money, so we're making it legally impossible for you to fire us.\"\n\n# The Fake Project\n\nTheir \"Tonopah Flats Lithium Project\" that they've been pushing? Let's read their own technical report:  \n   \n*\"Inferred Mineral Resource - the lowest level of geological confidence of all mineral resources, which prevents the application of the modifying factors in a manner useful for evaluation of economic viability... may not be considered when assessing the economic viability of a mining project.\"*\n\nThey've been drilling since 2021. FOUR YEARS. Still at \"Inferred\" classification. That's the mining equivalent of \"we think there might be lithium here but we're not sure and definitely can't tell you if it's profitable.\"\n\nAnd that Oct 13th PR about \"baseline studies\"? The 8-K explicitly states it \"**shall not be deemed to be 'filed'**\" - it's literally non-actionable PR fluff.\n\n# Why This Goes Lower\n\n1. **No viable business:** Four years, still at Inferred resources, no revenue, burning $10M+ per quarter\n2. **DOE grant loss removes credibility:** If the government won't fund you after auditing your books, why should retail?\n3. **Bylaws amendment attracts scrutiny:** That timing is TOO convenient. Class action lawyers are gonna have a field day.\n4. **Missing money:** $52M raised but only $7.5M in cash? Where'd it go? Salaries and stock comp while making no project progress.\n5. **Dilution death spiral:** They'll need more cash. Only source is more dilution. Stock goes lower. Need more cash. Repeat.\n\nNowww - they still have another grant from December '24 too. If DOE terminated the lithium grant for \"federal stewardship\" issues, what makes you think the recycling grant is safe? They're probably burning that money on salaries too.\n\nAnyways - read through the filings, it's not making much sense. Feels like they keep punting a project that never really gets done with directors fill their pockets with grant after grant.\n\n**Current positions:**\n\n* 500x Oct 17 $5 puts @ $0.10 avg\n* 400x Oct 17 $6 puts @ $0.47 avg\n* 150x Nov 21 $4 puts @ $0.40 avg\n* 180x Nov 21 $5 puts @ $0.85 avg\n* 160x Nov 21 $6 puts @ $1.48 avg\n\nPrice target - we open tomorrow at $4.10 or so (as is - we're already at $4.30 after hours). Next week or two, we drop to $2.50-$3.00 as fraud concerns emerge, maybe lower if SEC announces some investigation.",
