When I sold them I figured earnings were priced in, and was happy to take a profit and minimize risk.\n\nThen Thursday morning after earnings, I did the most impulsive retard thing and I re entered the position at market open after seeing the incredible earnings, and seeing that the contracts I had just sold were trading for less than I had sold them for. The price then dropped and I did something even more retarded, I doubled and tripled down on the position throughout the day Thursday. On Friday at close, Robinhood couldn't even liquidate the contacts at 0.01 each, so you can see a couple actually expired worthless. \n\nFeeling kind of retarded now.",
